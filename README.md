# Unity MeshToText Project

##Features
**Save Mesh to text or CS file, and load the Mesh from file.**

This unity project will write any mesh with unity standard variables format into a plain text or C# file.

Variables array: 
> Vector3[] vertices = { new Vector3(.... };

> Vector3[] normals = { new Vector3(.... };

> Vector4[] tangents = { new Vector4(.... };

> Vector2[] uv0 = { new Vector2(.... };

> Vector2[] uv2 = { new Vector2(.... };

> int[] triangles = { .... };

Check out the unity default cube primitive mesh to a csharp file [here](https://github.com/michael430/Unity_MeshToText/blob/master/Assets/BakedMeshData.cs).
(You can apply any custom mesh to Mesh Filter component to write as a file.)

Include example script to load the mesh from text file back to the scene in runtime.
